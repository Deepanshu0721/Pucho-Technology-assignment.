__Data visualization__ refers to the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it as visual objects contained in graphics. The goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users. It is one of the steps in data analysis or data science.

"Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency. Graphical displays should:
* show the data
* induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production or    something else
* avoid distorting what the data has to say
* present many numbers in a small space
* make large data sets coherent
* encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data
* reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine structure
* serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation or decoration
* be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.
